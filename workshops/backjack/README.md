Have you ever thought How you could create a simple and smart BlackJack game using, well You have come in the right place. You will How to use function(expectially Void Function) to it full potential.

## Getting started
This workshop is very friendly for beginner or advance c++ programmmer as it Help you practice and understand the use of Function in C++ and the manipulation of it.
We going to be using repl.it code editor to create our game. If you don't have an account yet go over to [repl.it](https://repl.it/signup) to create an account. To create a new C++ project in Repl.it just Click over [HERE](https://repl.it/languages/python3) and name your project to what you prefer.

## First step

Now Before we start, We see That Repl.it has already prepare for us the most important library ```iostream``` header file, But for this Game we will need to well generate random Number for all our Card;which ```iostream``` library doesn't support;and to make our code a bit simple, we will  not be using namespace ```Std::``` to declare a string variable or Given output  or an input . . Under ```Iostream``` Library we are going to call the Library that allow to generate Random number and inform the program that we are are not using ```std```
```C++
    #include <ctime>
    using namspace std;
```
  What did we just call Exaclty 
  -```ctime``` header file library will be use to help generate the random number using the program time. for ore about it you can Found it here at```link```
  -```using namespace std``` use it to tell the program that we will not be using std rather as a namespace which is just nothing.
  
  
Now that you have set evrything we need let to write some CODE!!!
![](git)

 
As I said in the beginning we be using the ```void()``` Function  to create this gamae, so instead of writing a butch of code into the ```main()``` function that we won't be able to control, the void function will allow us to have control over the code, whcih we need the most when creating any kind of game.

 so first say in few short word wha the first thing the person as to do, declaring variable...inside a function, now to write the code on this page you must use 3 of this
